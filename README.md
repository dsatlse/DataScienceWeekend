# Website for the LSESU Data Science Society

This is a static [website](https://dsatlse.github.io/) meant to be used to promote the LSESU Data Science Society's flagship eventmade with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). It is mostly cloned from the society's main static site: [github.com/dsatlse/dsatlse.github.io](github.com/dsatlse/dsatlse.github.io) 

## Development

> Dark minimalistic theme but with the banner color scheme? – just thought it would give a more tech feel compared to white (Example: https://www.liveworx.com/ ). Use the colour codes used on the banner? The colour codes can be found here under Data Science Weekend: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QINApTS3PGCQzPqqwMXQVa4E5SYxd1yY3lRrFQlOjew/edit?usp=sharing

> make the banner smaller? It seems a bit too big to be on the top. Also, it might be a better idea to just provide a title, subtitle and use a short description with the date

> Schedule can be replaced by infographic.








 – use a frame that blends into the background (a bit like our Facebook and Instagram posts), and, also maybe put the speaker pictures and then a description of them next to the picture? – frames could be something like this: https://www.epicurrence.com/ or this https://2017.summit.co/ 

 – something along the lines of infographics instead of long descriptions, doesn’t have to be complicated tho (https://www.inbound.com/blog ). for the challenges maybe we can put the main topic on the website and like a button that would direct people to the detailed information or the infographic? I’m not sure if this is possible but I think it would make the website looks neater 

- Schedule example (a simple but nice one) - https://www.epicurrence.com/ 

- Suggestions to possibly improve the website experience?

> Expand the FAQ, rather than making it a toggle, make it look "prettier" , might make it more welcoming to beginners/ attract people who don't know about data science weekend as they can easily see their questions being answered, nudging them to sign up. idk if it is technically possible tho 

- maybe add the key dates? i think it would be nice if people can just find all the deadline in one page so they don’t need to search here and there
